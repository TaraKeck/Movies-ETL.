# Movies-ETL

Purpose of Repository:
Amazing Prime is impressed with the datasets so far and would like to keep it updated on a daily basis.  The purpose of this repository was to refactor the code  to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

To acheive this, the following deliverables are included in Jupyter files:
- ETL_functiontest
- ETL_clean_wiki_movies
- ETL_clean_kaggle_data
